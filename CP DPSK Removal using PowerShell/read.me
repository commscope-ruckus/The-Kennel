Wanted to share a new script I wrote in PowerShell. It is for Cloudpath bulk removal of expired only DPSKs in a specific DPSK pool. If you have a big school with Cloudpath using DPSK Pools, they will probably face the same issue my school did. There is no way of bulk removing expired DPSKs from the interface, so this script helps out. The fill will need the extension to be converted to .ps1. Also, the script is unsigned, so PowerShell wonâ€™t run it unless some configurations are made.
